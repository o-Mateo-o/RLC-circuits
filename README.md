### Description
---
This repository contains the main assignment for the university course "Differential Equations in Technology". 
The project was created in collaboration with [Adam Kawałko](https://github.com/adasiek01).

The main points of our work were to:

* formulate the main differential equations describing this phenomenon,
* find the analytical solutions for the specific RLC circuit cases,
* do the complete analysis of the most interesting RLC features,
* make comparisons with the collected experimental data,
* implement numerical methods and test their accuracy,
* find the numerical solutions for different source cases.


### Guide
